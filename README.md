# TCP-Server-and-Client
simple tcp server and client ( Does NOT support multiple clients (i know it's shitty this was my first C# project) )

I only provided the scripts so you will have to create a console app project. Both server and client are written in C#

# Commands
get-ip | Returns IP Address

get-geo | Returns Location
